The Blades of Chaos were forged at the darkest 
depths of the Underworld by Ares himself. 
They were imbued with fire, which allowed them 
to ignite with every attack that the user performed. 
The Blades' chains would stretch out for a set distance 
with each attack, allowing for fluid movement no matter 
who wielded them. The chains of the blades were 
permanently seared onto the forearms of the wielder, 
which served as a reminder of their oath to 
the God of War, and could only be removed 
either by the God of War himself or when 
the wielder's time of servitude ended.
