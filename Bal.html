Baldur was an Aesir born to Odin and Freya 
and was the half-brother of Thor and TÃ½r. 
At some point in his life, his mother learned from 
the runes that he would die a "needless death". 
Determined to prevent his death at any cost, 
Freya placed a spell on him that made him invulnerable 
to all threats, physical or magical. 
The spell had one weakness, however: mistletoe. 
To make sure no one figured out the spell's weakness, 
she also cursed Mimir to prevent him from 
speaking about it.
