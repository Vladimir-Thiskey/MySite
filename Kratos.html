He is the protagonist of the God of War series. 
Born in Sparta, Kratos was a respected soldier 
and General, up until he lost his wife and 
daughter when he killed them, albeit 
by accident, under Ares' command, earning 
him the nickname of "The Ghost of Sparta", 
after which he renounced his service 
to the war god, eventually killing 
him and ascending to Godhood before 
exacting revenge against his father, the 
Olympians and the Titans who betrayed him.
